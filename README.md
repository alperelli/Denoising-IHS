# Denoising-IHS: Denoising Iterative Hessian Sketching

Denoising Iterative Hessian Sketching algorithm for Image reconstruction

The Denoising-IHS Toolbox contains the Matlab implementation of a fast and convergent algorithm for Computed Tomography reconstruction and Spectral CT material decomposition.

## Directories:

* **Fig_Block_Leverage_Scores**: this folder contains the Matlab function to generate the leverage scores and together with the plot and the data for the Astra explicit matric CT forward operator;
* **Spectral_CT_Dataset**: this folder contains the Matlab functions to access and load the psectral CT dataset available at [doi](10.5281/zenodo.4482071)
